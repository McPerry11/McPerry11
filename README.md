## Mack Perry L. Co ([@McPerry11](https://github.com/McPerry11))

I am a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science student, and I'm is also the current
team leader of the Research & Development Unit at University of the East - College of Computer Studies and Systems (UE CCSS). I honed my problem-solving skills and
critical and logical thinking in my high school years at a private Chinese school, and there I also gained
my passion for programming. I learned that programming can be a tool to solve real-world problems
and that I can make changes and improve the quality of life around me. I soon
participated in multiple hackathons, which are essentially competitions for promoting solution
technologies in existing economic, social, and environmental problems. I now have two years of full-stack
development experience in web applications and have already built multiple web application systems. I
aim to utilize and expand my knowledge, skills, and experiences by creating software solutions for real-world problems.
